## Description

Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science and are widely used in various applications, including compilers, databases, and operating systems. This repository explores the concept of binary trees and provides implementations for common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

The repository contains solutions to problems related to binary trees, including but not limited to:

- Tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Binary search tree operations (insertion, deletion, searching)
- Binary tree height and depth calculation
- Binary tree balancing (AVL trees, Red-Black trees)
- Binary tree serialization and deserialization
- Common interview questions and problems involving binary trees

## Technologies

The solutions and implementations are written in the C programming language. No external libraries are required.
Compile the C files using a C compiler of your choice (e.g., gcc): `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o binary_trees`
